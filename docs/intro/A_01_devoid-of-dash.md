# Devoid of Dash ðŸ’»

<font color='#DD6E0F'>Imagine a world... *without dashboards*. </font>

On a superficial glance, it would seem that nothing's changed. People continue to
interact in the same ways they've done day-after-day. Businesses continue to
operate in the same manners like clockwork. Information is shared and used as it
always has been. Life goes on...

**Such a conjecture couldn't be further from the truth.**

&nbsp; &nbsp;

<font color='#DD6E0F'> The 21st century is built on data. </font> With the
proliferation of data aggregation, structuring, and analysis, **Big Data** has
transformed our interconnected society.
<font color='#DD6E0F'>*Information is invaluable.*</font>

Millions, billions, and trillions of data values can be quickly analyzed via powerful
algorithms to uncover new patterns, interesting correlations, and unexpected conclusions. Yet
***messy code segments, lines of JSON output, and unconnected queries simply cannot capture***
all of the golden needles hidden within these massive haystacks of information.

<font color='#DD6E0F'>***With dashboards, our data can be transformed into powerful visualizations.***</font>

&nbsp; &nbsp;

But don't just take my word for it,

!!! quote "Al Shalloway, Founder of Net Objectives"
    Visualizations act as a campfire around which we gather to tell stories.

!!! quote "Carly Fiorina, Former CEO of Hewlett-Packard"
    The goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight.

&nbsp; &nbsp;

**Dashboards go hand-in-hand with any endeavor involving the collection of information.**
Knowing of their profound importance begs the question, how do we create our own?

Well for that, dear reader, we turn to our <font color='#DD6EOF'>Trusty Toolbox!</font>
