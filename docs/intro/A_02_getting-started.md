title: Why Dashboard?

# Trusty Toolbox ðŸ”¨

A dashboard consists of two fundamental components:

* Framework for <font color='#DD6EOF'>**loading, storing, and running algorithms to analyze datasets**</font>
* Framework for <font color='#DD6EOF'>**extracting and displaying valuable information from the data**</font>

Our toolbox contains the two perfect tools needed for these tasks...

## Introducing TigerGraph

TigerGraph is a **native parallel graph database** that can load and analyze large
amounts of data in real-time. In comparison to traditional relational databases,
TigerGraph's architecture and accompanying graph query language (GSQL) allow
for <font color='#DD6EOF'> **quick, efficient, and powerful analytics** </font>.

### Goin' Graphs

The following blog post summarizes the importance of Graph Databses.

For a more comprehensive overview, feel free to check out the following four modules:

As summarized neatly by Oracle,

!!! quote "Oracle's [*17 Use Cases for Graph Databases and Graph Analytics*](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/graph-database-use-cases-ebook.pdf?intcmp=:ow:lp:2t:::RC_WWMK210121P00001:&source=WWMK210121P00001+:ow:lp:2t:::RC_WWMK210121P00001:)"
    <font size=4> Graph technologies have become a **groundbreaking way** for organizations </font>
    <font size=4> everywhere to address uses that other methods simply canâ€™t address in an </font>
    <font size=4> **efficient manner**. </font>

Now, how do we go about creating our own?

### The Cloud Portal

TigerGraph graciously provides a free-tier cloud portal open to all. Creating an
account is as simple as navigating to its [website](https://tgcloud.io/) and clicking
on the orange **Login/Register** button. We'll cover setting up one's first solution
in the ensuing *"Dashboarding 101"* section.

For a brief introduction, feel free to check out the following video:

For now, we can move onto the second half of our toolbox...

&nbsp; &nbsp;

## Introducing Plotly

Plotly is an *interactive graphing library* used to visualize data.

It is quite powerful in terms of its features and is rather easy to learn and begin working with. Two Plotly modules we'll be using in
our dashboard can be summarized below:

* Plotly Express: <font color='#DD6EOF'>**a high-level wrapper for creating visualizations**</font>
* Plotly Dash: <font color='#DD6EOF'>**a Python framework for easily building applications**</font>

Both of these modules will be covered in the *"Dashboarding 101"* section.

&nbsp; &nbsp;

### All Aboard the Plotly Express

&nbsp; &nbsp;

Pretty exciting! <font color='#DD6EOF'>**TigerGraph + Plotly are both powerful, easy-to-use tools.** </font>

*Let's  learn how to harness their power to create dashboards...*

> While **"Quick Start"** contains a <font color='#DD6EOF'>condensed, no-fluff guide</font> to creating dashboards, **"Adventure"** weaves
the same content around an <font color='#DD6EOF'>immersive story.</font> Feel free to explore either!
